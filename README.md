# 안녕하세요! 👋 Welcome my Github

I'm interested in Algorithm Trading, AI, Data Analysis, Julia, Rust and passionate about learning itself.

## Interest

- Optimization By RL
- Algorithm Trading with AI
- Constuct Algorithm Trading Platform
  
<b>KeyWord: AI, Algorithm-Trading, Data-Analysis, Finance, Operation-Research </b>

## 2025 Plan
1. AI4Trading project - [In Private Repository - AI4Trading](https://github.com/donghui-0126/AI4Trading)
    - Algorithm Trading with AI (from 2024)
    - Trading 5 symbols on Binance (from 2024)
    - Market Making, Arbitrage Strategy with AI
      
2. Immigration Rust to Julia
   - From 2025, I chose Julia over Rust because I thought Rust would have difficulties with extensibility.
   - [In Private Repository - Hello-Julia-World](https://github.com/donghui-0126/Hello-Julia-World)
## TODO List
- Orderbook Reconstruct | Rust to Julia
- Online Websocket | Julia
- Offline Dataset Simulation | Rust to Julia
- Tick Data Analysis & EDA Pipeline
- Feature Store | Rust to Julia
- Model Training (Complete PoC | 2024.12.20)
- BackTest
- Trading!
